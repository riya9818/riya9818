# Hi, I'm Riya Basnet

I'm a Python Django developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, structured, and working systems. I focus on backend development, database design, and integration. 

Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from land rental systems and e-commerce platforms to data analysis dashboards. Iâ€™m currently improving my full-stack workflow and refining how I design, build, and deploy Django-based applications.
